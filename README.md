# bhp-trojan-Public

This is the public version of a python based trojan. This trojan model (and code) comes from the 2nd edition of the book Black Hat Python. Modules are found in the modules directory of the repository the trojan is tasked to call back to. Configuration files instructing each trojan which modules to run are found in the config directory, and trojans receive instructions based on unique IDs. Data collected from running modules is pushed to the data directory in the callback repository.
